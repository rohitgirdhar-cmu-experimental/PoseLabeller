Tool to label images with human pose in [LEEDS Sports dataset format](http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/mat4saj/lsp.html)

Note on Usage
-------------
Just mark out the part one after other, based on what
appears on the terminal. Mark part visible, as long as
some of the part is visible => hips are always marked visible
even if the front of the person is in the image. Only mark
not visible if the part if hidden by another body part
